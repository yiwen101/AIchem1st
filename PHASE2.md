# Phase 2 Implementation Plan: Knowledge Management & Planning Intelligence

The Phase 1 implementation has established the foundational architecture and a minimal end-to-end system. Phase 2 will focus on enhancing the knowledge graph context system and creating more dynamic planning capabilities. This document outlines the specific tasks for Phase 2.

## 1. Knowledge Manager Enhancement (~350 LOC)

- Develop graph-based relevance scoring algorithm

### Context Management Features
- Implement context pruning strategies based on relevance scores
- Add recency bias weighting to favor recent observations
- Create entity merging algorithms to handle duplicate information
- Implement contradiction detection and resolution

### Context Query Capabilities
- Add query capabilities to extract structured information
- Implement path-based relationship queries
- Create hypothesis ranking and testing mechanisms
- Add support for traversing the knowledge graph

## 2. Planner Enhancement (~300 LOC)

### Dynamic Planning

- Add error pattern recognition
- Create error severity assessment
- Implement early failure detection

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Develop sophisticated retry mechanisms
- Add parameter adjustment for failed actions
- Implement alternative action selection
- Create recovery planning capabilities

### Fallback Strategies
- Enhance fallback selection logic
- Add support for cascading fallbacks
- Implement fallback success monitoring
- Create fallback performance tracking

## Implementation Approach

1. **Development Order**
   - Begin with knowledge manager enhancements to improve context quality
   - Next, implement planner improvements to leverage the enhanced context
   - Then develop the improved prompting system
   - Finally, add the error handling capabilities

2. **Integration Strategy**
   - Maintain backward compatibility with Phase 1 components
   - Use feature flags to enable/disable new capabilities
   - Implement components incrementally with unit tests
   - Conduct integration testing throughout development

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Create specialized test scenarios for each new feature
   - Develop benchmark tests to measure improvements
   - Implement regression tests to prevent regressions
   - Conduct end-to-end testing with complex scenarios
