I am working on generating a comprehensive list of tools for video understanding agent. The tools may include but not limited to calls to CV models and tools, query to different kind of llm and computer use. Can you study the following sample questions, and try to think of what list of tools I should prepare for the agent system so that it always have a way to use a sequence (and combination) of tool calls to get the necessary information to answer these questions? 

Please save your list of tools into a file named "toollist.md".

Following are sample questions to my agent system in json format. You do not have to answer them or process the video, simply help me figure out what tools are helpful in answering them
