Response from querying llm with 16 images between 0 and 19.55 seconds of the video of duration 19.55 seconds.

Description: The video appears to depict humorous scenarios related to video game glitches, featuring a person in a blue shirt interacting with a red cup and a small white ball. Throughout the sequence, there are various visual effects and distortions applied, simulating glitches. In some frames, the character's appearance changes drastically, such as becoming pixelated or displaying error messages. These effects enhance the comedic aspect, portraying how glitches affect character behaviors and interactions in video games.
Information for answer: Based on the images, there are at least three noticeable instances of artificial edits: the character becoming pixelated (images 8 and 9), the presence of an error message (image 10), and potential changes in the character's speed and movement throughout the sequence. These elements suggest that visual effects were intentionally added to mimic video game glitches.

Response from querying llm with 8 images between 6.625138888888889 and 11.51263888888889 seconds of the video of duration 19.55 seconds.

Description: The video appears to showcase a humorous take on video game glitches. Initially, a man in a blue shirt stands with his arms out, facing a red cup. The subsequent images depict a progression of graphical distortions, as the figure becomes increasingly pixelated and glitchy, eventually culminating in a distorted error display. The imagery seems designed to mimic common video game errors or graphical glitches, creating a comedic effect.
Information for answer: The video exhibits multiple artificially edited parts, specifically through the use of visual effects that simulate glitches. The transition from a normal appearance to heavily distorted forms indicates several edits aimed at creating the glitch effect. The most rigidly altered images feature the subject distorted into pixelated and checkered patterns. There are at least three significant edits identified within the sequence of images, particularly images three through seven, where the figure undergoes visual transformations to resemble various glitches. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are multiple parts of the video that have been artificially edited.

Response from querying llm with 2 images between 10.203487103174604 and 11.425362103174605 seconds of the video of duration 19.55 seconds.

Description: The video depicts a humorous take on video game glitches. In the first image, a man is shown standing by a red cup, but his appearance is distortedâ€”his body is covered in a pixelated pattern, suggesting a visual glitch typical of video games. The caption further characterizes this as part of a series about video game glitches. In the second image, the same man has transformed into a figure with a checkered pattern, accompanied by the word 'ERROR' in bright red. This further reinforces the theme of glitch aesthetics, showcasing multiple forms of visual distortion.
Information for answer: Both images in the segment depict elements that appear artificially edited, highlighting glitches. The alterations to the man's appearance and the addition of the 'ERROR' text suggest clear artificial editing. Since both images represent distinct edited states, it can be inferred that at least two parts of the video have been artificially edited to create this glitch effect.
