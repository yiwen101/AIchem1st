Response from querying llm with 10 images between 0 and 10.97 seconds of the video of duration 10.97 seconds.

Description: In the video, a girl is seen attempting to navigate a steep ramp. She starts by climbing or running up the ramp, then reaches a position where she is hanging or has already moved past the top of the ramp. As she climbs, she eventually achieves a position where she's on top of a green platform. She appears to celebrate or express happiness after making it to the top. The environment looks like a training facility with ramps and a scoreboard in the background that lists names and scores related to the activity. The girl wears a black outfit and has red hair, and her footwear is notably pink. She interacts with the scoreboard after her climb.
Information for answer: The girl climbs up a ramp or wall and reaches the top, but the specific number of steps she took before reaching the top is not visually clear in the images provided. However, her motions suggest she ran before she began to hang on the wall, indicating a physical effort to climb. The images do not provide a direct count of the steps she took, focusing more on her position on the wall and her expressions after reaching the top.

Information for answer: The images depict a girl climbing a steep wall, but there are no clear indicators of the exact number of steps she took before reaching the top. Her actions suggest she likely had to run or jump to achieve enough height to ascend the wall, but specific counting of steps cannot be definitively observed from the images provided.

Response from querying llm with 1 images between 4.457187500000001 and 5.142812500000001 seconds of the video of duration 10.97 seconds.

Description: The image shows a girl with red hair, wearing a black shirt, who appears to be at the top of an inclined surface that is likely part of an indoor obstacle course or climbing wall. The structure is green with various markings but does not depict any stairs. In the background, a fan and a black board with notes can be seen.
Information for answer: Based on the image, it is unclear how many steps the girl took before reaching the top, as the image does not showcase her running or any visible steps leading up to the top. The angle of the structure may imply a climbing motion rather than running steps.
