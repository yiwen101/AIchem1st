Response from querying llm with 15 images between 0 and 15.0 seconds of the video of duration 15.0 seconds.

Description: The video demonstrates capillary action using colored water and cups. It begins with pouring water into the cups, followed by the addition of food coloring to observe its movement. After demonstrating mixing with a stick, a piece of paper is used to connect the cups. The water then moves through the paper, creating visible bridges of color. A clock appears in the video, showing the time progression of this phenomenon as the colored water moves between the cups over a time-lapsed sequence.
Information for answer: The time lapse of the demonstration of capillary action lasts from the moment the paper is placed to connect the cups until the colors fully rise and blend together. This occurs prominently in the final images where the clock indicates the elapsed time.

Response from querying llm with 7 images between 7.703571428571429 and 11.45357142857143 seconds of the video of duration 15.0 seconds.

Description: The video demonstrates a capillary action experiment where colored liquids are drawn between containers through porous materials. The video shows five containers, each holding a different color liquid (blue, green, orange, and one empty). There are hands interacting with these containers, and a clock in the background that suggests the passage of time. The last three images show an accelerated time lapse of the liquid movement across the containers, with visible changes in the arrangement of liquids over time.
Information for answer: The time lapse of the demonstration of capillary action lasts from approximately 7.703571428571429 seconds to 11.45357142857143 seconds, which amounts to a physical time duration of about 3.75 seconds in the video.

Response from querying llm with 1 images between 9.10982142857143 and 10.04732142857143 seconds of the video of duration 15.0 seconds.

Description: The image displays a visual demonstration of capillary action. There are four cups with different colored liquidsâ€”blue, green, and orange. Each cup has a strip connecting it to the next, illustrating how the liquids move through the strips. An alarm clock is shown in the image, suggesting a timing aspect of the demonstration.
Information for answer: The extraction took place from 9.1098 seconds to 10.0473 seconds of the 15.0-second video, lasting precisely 0.9375 seconds.
