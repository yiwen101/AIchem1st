Response from querying llm with 16 images between 0 and 17.74 seconds of the video of duration 17.74 seconds.

Description: The video shows a dog interacting with a wooden board that has several holes in it. The dog appears to be eagerly sniffing and licking the surface of the board while showing moments of curiosity and excitement. The dog's focus is primarily on the holes, suggesting a game or activity involving something hidden within those openings. There are frames where the dog's expression changes, showing anticipation or eagerness. The consistent focus on the holes indicates that the action may involve retrieving or discovering items that pop up from them.
Information for answer: In the video, the dog seems to engage with the holes in the board multiple times, suggesting that items (likely sausages) could be popping up from those holes. However, the exact count of how many times the sausage pops up is not directly observable from the images provided, as they do not show a clear moment of a sausage popping up. The dog's repeated interaction implies multiple instances, but the precise number is ambiguous based on the images alone.
