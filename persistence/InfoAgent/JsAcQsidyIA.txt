Description: The video shows a person demonstrating a mathematical process on a piece of paper. The paper features a polynomial expression to be factored, with the initial question and various steps of the factoring process clearly written out. Using a marker, the person writes and revises equations, emphasizing different parts of the polynomial with color-coded text. The writing itself appears neat and legible throughout, focused entirely on mathematical content without any other distractions in the visuals. 

Most importantly, all writing is predominantly in a vibrant red color, making it stand out against the white background of the paper. Additionally, some annotations appear in blue or green boxes for emphasis, but the main mathematical writing remains in red.
Information for answer: The writing on the paper in the video is predominantly red. Although some additional text is highlighted in blue and green boxes, the core content and equations which the individual is solving are written in red.
