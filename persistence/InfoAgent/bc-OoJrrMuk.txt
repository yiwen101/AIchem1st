Response from querying llm with 15 images between 0 and 15.72 seconds of the video of duration 15.72 seconds.

Description: In the video, a person appears to be writing on a surface with a pen. Initially, the person writes a sequence of numbers starting from '1' and continues up to '128', followed by a mathematical expression that includes the number '9' and then '98C'. Eventually, the writing transitions to the words 'I love you'. The background suggests a casual setting, with the person wearing a simple black shirt and having headphones on.
Information for answer: The person seems to be writing on a single sheet of paper throughout the video, with no indication of any layers of paper beneath the visible writing surface. This is deduced from the continuous flow of writing and the visibility of a consistent, flat writing surface without any indication of multiple layers.
