Response from querying llm with 15 images between 0 and 15.12 seconds of the video of duration 15.12 seconds.

Description: The video contains a series of images depicting two colorful circles with arrows indicating different directions. The speaker appears to engage with the audience, discussing the movement of these circles. The circles on the left and right feature various directional arrows, suggesting that the focus is on how the viewer perceives movement in these shapes. The speaker encourages viewers to consider their perception of directionality based on the visual cues provided by the arrows in relation to the circles.
Information for answer: The circle on the left, based on the arrows displayed in multiple images, is indicated to be moving to the left from the camera's perspective. The visual cues (arrows) consistently point towards the left side in the relevant frames, supporting this movement direction. Images that explicitly show the leftward arrows are pivotal to understanding this visual representation of movement.
