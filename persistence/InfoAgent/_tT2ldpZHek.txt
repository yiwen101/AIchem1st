Response from querying llm with 4 images between 20.479374999999994 and 23.375624999999992 seconds of the video of duration 46.34 seconds.

Description: The images depict a person engaged in various activities involving a treadmill. In the first image, the individual appears to be balancing on a large ball while on the treadmill, suggesting a playful or exercise-related action. The next three images show the person using a tripod on the treadmill, presumably while changing a light bulb in the room. The room features a bed, a dresser, and a well-lit window. Notably, the treadmill appears to be stationary and not in motion, as the person is using it as a platform rather than running on it.
Information for answer: The treadmill is not running in any of the images; the person is using it as a surface to stand on while performing other tasks, such as changing a light bulb. Therefore, it can be concluded that the treadmill is not active while the person is engaged in these activities, which means it is not running while the person is sleeping.
