Response from querying llm with 10 images between 0 and 10.45 seconds of the video of duration 10.45 seconds.

Description: The video features three strips of different colors: black, red, and a blue/turquoise color, which the narrator examines to determine their lengths. The strips are shown in various arrangements, with close-ups highlighting the comparisons. The narrator questions which color is the shortest, pointing to the strips as they measure them visually. In the latter images, the strips are aligned and labeled for clarity, and the final image indicates that the black strip is confirmed as the shortest, with a check mark next to it.
Information for answer: The black strip is identified as the shortest compared to the red and blue strips. Observations across the images consistently show the lengths of the black, red, and blue strips being compared, ultimately leading to the conclusion that the black one is the shortest.

Response from querying llm with 5 images between 8.99375 and 11.60625 seconds of the video of duration 10.45 seconds.

Description: The video displays three color strips: a black strip (A), a red strip (B), and a blue strip (C). The black strip is marked as longer than the red and blue strips, indicating the lengths are being compared. The images show the strips being pointed at, and in each frame, the comparison continues with a consistent emphasis on the black strip being the longest. The background is a blue surface, and the strips are arranged horizontally on a white sheet.
Information for answer: Based on the images, the red strip (B) appears to be the shortest compared to the black strip (A), which is the longest. The blue strip (C) seems to be similar in length to the red strip but appears to be longer than it. Since the question asks for the shortest long strip, the red strip (B) is identified as the shortest.

Response from querying llm with 1 images between 8.6671875 and 9.3203125 seconds of the video of duration 10.45 seconds.

Description: The image displays three long strips arranged side by side on a white surface. There are text labels indicating the colors and lengths of the strips: A is black, B is red, and C is blue. Two hands are pointing at the strips for measurement comparison. The background appears to be a solid blue color.
Information for answer: Among the colored strips, the black strip labeled 'A' is the longest, the red strip labeled 'B' is the shortest, and the blue strip labeled 'C' is of equal length to the red strip. Therefore, the color of the long strip that is the shortest is red.
