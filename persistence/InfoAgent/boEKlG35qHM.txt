Response from querying llm with 15 images between 0 and 15.62 seconds of the video of duration 15.62 seconds.

Description: The video depicts a person in a field working with banana plants. They are using a machete-like tool to cut or strike at a plastic covering that appears to be protecting a bunch of bananas. The person is dressed in protective clothing and is focused on the task at hand. Throughout the images, there's a consistent motion of the individual raising the tool above their head and seemingly preparing to cut at the stem or support structures of the banana bunches.
Information for answer: In the sequence of images, the person is seen making multiple strikes with the tool, but determining the exact number of times they cut the stem is challenging without specific indicators showing a complete severing. However, it appears that the individual may be performing several cutting motions aimed at one specific stem or group of stems across different images.
