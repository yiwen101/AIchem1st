{"youtube_video_description":"The video demonstrates a science experiment involving atmospheric pressure and candle combustion. The presenter poses a question about what will happen when a glass vase is placed over candles sitting in water. As the experiment unfolds, viewers learn that the water moves into the vase not due to the candles consuming oxygen, but because the heat from the candles warms the air, and when they go out, the cooling air allows atmospheric pressure to push the water inside the vase. The video likely combines educational elements with a visual demonstration of physical principles related to air pressure and thermodynamics.","hint_prompt":"What does the man light in the video to demonstrate the experiment?"}
