{"youtube_video_description":"The video titled \"So close 🤏🏼,yet so far ♾️\" is a creative visualization of the mathematical constant Pi. It is an animation where an outer arm rotates at a speed π times faster than the inner arm, illustrating the concept that the arm will never align perfectly with its starting point due to the irrational nature of Pi. The creator highlights the never-ending chase of the outer arm that always misses the target by a small, nearly invisible margin. The video has gained significant attention and virality across social media platforms, showcasing a unique blend of mathematics and satisfying visuals. It also includes Python code to generate a corresponding drawing based on this concept, emphasizing the artistic aspect of mathematical principles. The video is just under one minute long, and there are no verbal explanations provided in it, relying instead on visuals to convey its message.","hint_prompt":"Identify the total number of zoomed-in close-ups presented in the video and provide a count."}
