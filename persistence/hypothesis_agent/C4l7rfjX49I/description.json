Initially, the dad holds the baby and approaches the mom, who is sitting. The baby reaches out towards the mom with a pleasant expression, indicating interest and affection. The dad smiles as he watches this interaction. Next, the scene transitions to the dad and mom together holding the baby, with the baby facing the dad. The baby looks at the dad with curiosity and a neutral expression, suggesting comfort but not as much enthusiasm as earlier. Finally, the baby is presented to the big brother, and the energy shifts. The baby visibly brightens, smiling broadly and showing excitement when interacting with the sibling. The baby's reaction suggests a special bond with the big brother, highlighted by the baby's happy and animated expressions.", "significant_events": ["Baby reaches out to mom with smiling expression.", "Baby is held by both parents, looking at dad with curiosity.", "Baby smiles broadly at big brother, showing excitement."], "hint_prompt": "Observe the baby's expressions and actions when they see each family member, focusing on smiles, reaching out, or looking intrigued to determine their reaction to each interaction."}
