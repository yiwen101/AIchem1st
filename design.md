# Video Understanding Agent Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a question-answering workflow agent specialized in video understanding. The agent follows a recursive "eval, apply" loop pattern that breaks down complex questions into manageable sub-questions, maintains a history of answers, and utilizes various tools to gather information as needed.

## Core Architecture

### Key Components

1. **AgentCoordinator**
   - Main entry point that manages the workflow
   - Handles user input and returns final answers
   - Tracks the current state of the question-answering process

2. **QuestionEvaluator**
   - Analyzes questions to determine their type (primitive or complex)
   - Identifies which tools or approaches are needed

3. **SubQuestionGenerator**
   - Creates relevant sub-questions for complex queries
   - Ensures sub-questions are properly formulated (starting with what, why, how, when, who, etc.)

4. **QuestionSolver**
   - Resolves primitive questions using context, notebook, or tools
   - Integrates information from sub-questions to solve complex questions

5. **NotebookManager**
   - Maintains a history of questions and their answers
   - Provides retrieval capabilities for referencing past answers

6. **ToolManager**
   - Interfaces with various tools for video analysis
   - Selects appropriate tools based on question requirements
   - Processes tool outputs into usable information

### Types of Questions

1. **Primitive Questions**
   - **Context-Based**: Can be answered directly from provided context knowledge
   - **Notebook-Based**: Can be answered by referencing past Q&A pairs
   - **Tool-Assisted**: Require using tools to gather information before answering

2. **Complex Questions**
   - Require breaking down into multiple sub-questions
   - Need integration of multiple pieces of information
   - May involve sequential reasoning steps

## Workflow Process

```
1. User submits query + context knowledge
2. AgentCoordinator receives the query
3. QuestionEvaluator determines question type
4. If PRIMITIVE:
   a. QuestionSolver attempts to answer using context/notebook
   b. If needed, ToolManager executes relevant tools
   c. Answer is formulated and returned
5. If COMPLEX:
   a. SubQuestionGenerator creates important sub-question
   b. AgentCoordinator is called recursively with sub-question
   c. When sub-question is answered, NotebookManager updates
   d. Parent question continues processing with new information
   e. Process repeats until original question can be answered
6. Final answer is returned to user
7. NotebookManager updates with complete Q&A pair
```

## Tool Integration

The agent will support various tools for video understanding:

1. **VideoFrameExtractor**: Captures frames from specific timestamps
2. **ObjectDetector**: Identifies objects within video frames
3. **ActionRecognizer**: Recognizes actions being performed
4. **SceneClassifier**: Identifies the setting or environment
5. **TranscriptGenerator**: Creates text from speech in videos
6. **FacialRecognition**: Identifies people in the video
7. **EmotionAnalyzer**: Detects emotional states of subjects
8. **TemporalAnalyzer**: Identifies time-based patterns and sequences

## Notebook Structure

The notebook maintains a hierarchical history of questions and answers:

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "What is happening in this video?",
      "answer": "A cooking demonstration showing how to make pasta carbonara.",
      "timestamp": "2023-07-22T14:30:00Z",
      "tools_used": ["SceneClassifier", "ActionRecognizer"],
      "sub_questions": [
        {
          "id": "q1.1",
          "question": "What objects are visible in the video?",
          "answer": "Cooking utensils, pasta, eggs, cheese, and bacon.",
          "tools_used": ["ObjectDetector"]
        },
        {
          "id": "q1.2",
          "question": "What actions is the person performing?",
          "answer": "Boiling pasta, mixing ingredients, and stirring the sauce.",
          "tools_used": ["ActionRecognizer"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Considerations

### Recursion Control
- Maximum recursion depth to prevent infinite loops
- Timeout mechanisms for long-running processes
- Detection of circular reasoning patterns

### Context Management
- Efficient passing of relevant context to sub-questions
- Prioritization of recent notebook entries over older ones
- Tracking of context relevance scores

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when tools fail or return unexpected results
- User prompting for clarification when needed
- Uncertainty representation in answers

### Performance Optimization
- Caching of tool results for frequently asked questions
- Parallel processing of independent sub-questions
- Prioritization of computationally inexpensive tools

## Implementation Approach

The system will be implemented as a modular architecture with clear interfaces between components. This allows for:

1. Easy replacement or upgrading of individual components
2. Addition of new tools as they become available
3. Adjustment of reasoning strategies based on performance feedback
4. Potential for specialized instances focused on particular video domains

## Future Extensions

1. **Multi-modal Input**: Support for user providing images, audio, or text alongside queries
2. **Self-improvement**: Learning from successful and unsuccessful question-answering attempts
3. **Collaborative Answering**: Multiple agents specializing in different aspects working together
4. **User Preference Learning**: Adapting to individual user needs and preferences over time
5. **Explanation Generation**: Providing reasoning traces for how answers were derived

## Initial Implementation Plan

1. Develop core AgentCoordinator and question evaluation logic
2. Implement basic NotebookManager for storing and retrieving Q&A pairs
3. Create interfaces for tool integration, starting with fundamental video analysis tools
4. Build SubQuestionGenerator with basic reasoning capabilities
5. Integrate all components with a simple user interface
6. Test with progressively more complex video understanding tasks
7. Refine and optimize based on performance observations
